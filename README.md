# airbnb-clone-project

📘 Overview  
The Airbnb Clone project is a full-featured web application designed to emulate the core functionality of the Airbnb platform.  
It allows users to book stays, list properties, and manage reservations through a modern and responsive interface.  
This project is intended as a learning and portfolio-building tool for aspiring full-stack developers and software engineers.  

🎯 Project Goal  
The goal of this project is to replicate the primary features of Airbnb by implementing a robust backend system,  
efficient API layer, and scalable services using industry-standard tools and practices.  
It also focuses on implementing asynchronous task handling, data caching, containerized environments,  
and continuous integration/deployment pipelines.  

🧰 Technology Stack  
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.  
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.  
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.  
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.  
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.  
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.  
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.  
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
