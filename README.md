# airbnb-clone-project

## 📘 Overview
The Airbnb Clone project is a full-featured web application designed to emulate the core functionality of the Airbnb platform.  
It allows users to book stays, list properties, and manage reservations through a modern and responsive interface.  
This project is intended as a learning and portfolio-building tool for aspiring full-stack developers and software engineers.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to replicate the primary features of Airbnb by implementing a robust backend system,  
efficient API layer, and scalable services using industry-standard tools and practices.  
It also focuses on implementing asynchronous task handling, data caching, containerized environments,  
and continuous integration/deployment pipelines.

## 🧰 Technology Stack

This project utilizes a modern, scalable tech stack to deliver efficient backend performance and development workflows:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API and handling backend logic.
- **Django REST Framework**: A powerful toolkit that simplifies the creation of REST APIs in Django.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database system used for persistent data storage and complex queries.
- **GraphQL**: Provides a flexible approach to querying data and helps reduce over-fetching or under-fetching of data in APIs.
- **Celery**: A distributed task queue used for handling asynchronous operations like email delivery and background tasks.
- **Redis**: Serves as a fast in-memory data store used for caching, queuing, and session management.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments through containerization.
- **CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions)**: Automates code testing, building, and deployment to speed up development and reduce human error.
